# LeNet5
We describe the components and how to built a convolution neural network (CNN) similar to that described in <u>Gradient Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition</u> by LeCunn et al.. We built all the necessary layers/components  using `Theano` and test various gradient descent methods on the MNIST dataset.

The network will consist of a series of convolution layers, pooling layers and a fully connected layer and can be visualized by the following diagram 

![Alt text](/LeNet5/Notebook/architec2.png?raw=true "LeNet5").

We show how to implement various forms of gradient descent and show how to define the `Exponential Linear Unit (ELU)` as described in <u>Fast and accurate deep network learning by exponetial lienar units</u> by Clevert et al. 

The full describtion can be found in the ipython notebook located in the `Notebook` directory.
